These Goulash Recipes contain some of the best old fashioned meals full of beef, tomatoes, elbow macaroni, and shredded cheddar cheese. Your whole family will love them!

If you're looking to recreate a dish that your grandmother used to make for you, then this is the right place to look! Goulash has been around for hundreds of years and is one of the simplest yet most delicious dinner recipes that you can make!

Goulash is known as a quick and easy dish to create and it really is, especially when you use a ground meat, tomato sauce, and pasta combinations. However, if you want to fix a more traditional Hungarian goulash recipe with chunks of beef, plan on at least a couple of hours of simmering for tender meat. It is still a simple meal to prepare, but unfortunately you can’t get the old fashioned goulash recipe on the table within 30 minutes!

Most goulash recipes call for stovetop cooking of the ingredients but anyone with a crock pot knows how wonderful they are for cooking any kind of stew. If you don’t want to or can’t keep an eye on the stove, using a crock pot is a great way to tenderize the meat. Slow cooker goulash recipes have a lot of flavor without all the hassle of watching a pan.</section>

  	<section>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]

Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.</section>
